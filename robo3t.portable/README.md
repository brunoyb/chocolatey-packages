Formerly known as Robomongo (more info on https://robomongo.org/), Robo 3T is a shell-centric cross-platform MongoDB management tool. Unlike most other MongoDB admin UI tools, Robo 3T embeds the actual `mongo` shell in a tabbed interface with access to a shell command line as well as GUI interaction.
