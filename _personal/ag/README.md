# The Silver Searcher


A code searching tool similar to `ack`, with a focus on speed.

## Features

* It is an order of magnitude faster than `ack`.
* It ignores file patterns from your `.gitignore` and `.hgignore`.
* If there are files in your source repo you don't want to search, just add their patterns to a `.ignore` file. (\*cough\* `*.min.js` \*cough\*)
* The command name is 33% shorter than `ack`, and all keys are on the home row!
