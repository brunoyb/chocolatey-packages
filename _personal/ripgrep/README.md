# ripgrep (rg)


`ripgrep` is a line oriented search tool that combines the usability of The Silver Searcher (similar to `ack`) with the raw speed of GNU grep. `ripgrep` works by recursively searching your current directory for a regex pattern. `ripgrep` has first class support on Windows, Mac and Linux.
